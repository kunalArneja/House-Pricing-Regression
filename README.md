# Project Name

> Exploring Regression methods such as Ridge and Lasso to understand the pricing dynamics of a new market.

## Conclusions

### Ridge Model was slighly better in terms of R2 Scores but the model was much more complex with around 144 features

### The Lasso Model had comparable R2 scores for train and test, It also tells us a lot about the insignificant features in the Feature set. Thus creating a simpler model. Hence we will go for Lasso model
